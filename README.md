# 🛒 PriceCheck  
**Community-powered grocery price tracker & savings optimizer.**

---

## 🌟 About  
PriceCheck was created by a busy shopping dad who grew up learning the **thrill of the hunt** from his coupon-savvy mom. Today, it’s a tool for everyone — families, students, and individuals — to **save money together, keep stores honest, and make smarter grocery decisions.**

---

## ✨ Vision & Promise  
- **Community First** → Users confirm each other’s price updates for accuracy  
- **Checks & Balances** → Stores are held accountable through crowdsourced pricing  
- **Inclusive** → Built for parents, students, and anyone who wants to spend smarter  
- **Trustworthy & Friendly** → Approachable design, teal branding, and warm tone  

---

## 🚀 Features (Current + Planned)  
- ✅ Crowdsourced **price updates** with verification system (gamified points)  
- ✅ **Shopping list optimizer**: import from Notes/Reminders or create in-app → app suggests best store-by-store strategy  
- ✅ **Coupon stacking**: track and apply store + manufacturer coupons  
- 🕒 **Product reviews & insights**: community feedback, monetizable for brands  
- 🕒 **Receipt rewards integration**: connect to post-purchase rebate programs  
- 🕒 **AI-powered shopping assistant** (long-term)  

---

## 🧩 Gamified Points System  
- Submit a price change → **+2 points** (confirmed after 2 verifications)  
- Verify a change → **+1 point**  
- Deny a false change (with another verifier) → **+1 point** each  

This system keeps updates **honest** while rewarding community effort.
